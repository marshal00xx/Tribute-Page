                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi, formerly known as the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, grants the user's rubber-like body increased strength and freedom, limited only by the user's imagination. It is for this reason that the user is said to become the "embodiment of freedom", able to bring joy to the people around them and making it "the most ridiculous power in the world".[3] One of the most notable features of the awakened form is granting cartoon-like effects, not only to the user, but also to multiple people who are close enough to see and/or be around the user, including their opponent, an example being eye-popping effects, and cartoonish welts after a head injury; also, while in this state, the user displays a grand state of elation, laughter and confidence.</p>

                <p>In this state, Luffy's heartbeat takes on a musical rhythm which has been described by Zunesha as the "Drums of Liberation" (解放のドラム Kaihō no Doramu?).[4] His hair and clothes turn white,[5] his eyes glow with white rings, and white clouds float around his neck, similar to the clouds of steam that accompany him in Gear Fourth. The amount of Haki released from this form was enough that it could be felt all the way to the Live Floor in the Skull Dome, knocking multiple Beasts Pirates out in the process. The very sound of Luffy's heartbeat in this state could be heard all throughout Onigashima, alarming several and alerting them to the fact that Luffy was alive and well.</p>

                <p>Aligning with the Mythical Zoan nature of this new form, Luffy's already rubbery body gains strength, freedom and durability that surpasses what he would receive from his previous forms, to the point that it is now even cartoonishly malleable, with Kaidou likening it to "something out of a picture book". An example of this is when Luffy took a direct hit from one of Kaidou's Bolo Breath attacks, only to come out of it being barely hurt, his body being charred (somewhat comedically) and then him running back to fight Kaidou. Another example is when he reactivated Gear 5 and took a hit to the head from Kaidou's Hassaikai, only for his head to warp and wrap around the weapon and its spikes, or when Kaidou tried to smash him into the ground, his body was simply squished instead and later returned to its original shape.</p>

                <p>Luffy is able to utilize both the limb inflation of Gear 3 and the muscle inflation of Gear 4 without the need to pump air into his body first, which he first used against Kaidou. He was able to increase his arm to an enormous size in order to grab Kaidou's transformed body and yank him up out of the Skull Dome. With his enlarged limbs and muscles, Luffy could easily manhandle Kaidou despite his enormous size, swinging him from side to side. Luffy can also perform the inflation over his entire body at once, transforming himself into a giant of massive size.</p>
                <h3>techniques</h3>
                <p>Gomu Gomu no Fusen (ゴムゴムの風船 Gomu Gomu no Fūsen?, literally meaning "Rubber Rubber Balloon"): A variant of Luffy's standard technique, unlike the original technique, Luffy's body becomes extremely buoyant, like a helium balloon. This was first used against Kaidou in his dragon form, where Luffy he entered the Emperor's body and expanded himself as well as the dragon.[8] In the VIZ Manga, this is called Gum-Gum Balloon.</p>
                <p>Gomu Gomu no Dasshutsu Rocket (ゴムゴムの脱出ロケット Gomu Gomu no Dasshutsu Roketto?, literally meaning "Rubber Rubber Escape Rocket"): A technique used by Luffy to escape from inside Kaidou's body after using "Gomu Gomu no Fusen". Luffy stretches his arms through his opponent's eyes and grabs onto their nose to launch himself out.[9] In the VIZ Manga, this is called Gum-Gum Escape Rocket.</p>
                <p>Gomu Gomu no Gigant (ゴムゴムの巨人ギガント Gomu Gomu no Giganto?, literally meaning "Rubber Rubber Giant"): A technique where Luffy expands himself to the size of a literal giant, as if activating Gear 3 on his entire body.[10] The name of the technique follows the Gear 3 naming theme, but without anything after "Gigant". In the VIZ Manga, this is called Gum-Gum Giant.</p>
                <p>Gomu Gomu no Nawatobi (ゴムゴムの縄跳び Gomu Gomu no Nawatobi?, literally meaning "Rubber Rubber Skipping Rope"): The giant-sized Luffy grabs Kaidou in his dragon form and uses Kaidou's serpentine body as a skipping rope.[11] In the VIZ Manga, this is called Gum-Gum Jump Rope.</p>
